# STEP 1. Import datasets.
'''
Raw data cannot be used for training directly, so you need to preprocess it. 
In order to check the preprocessed data format for esnet training and testing, 
import sample datasets that esnet provides.
Of course, you may import any sample datasets you like and start esnet training with it.
See the sample dataset lists that esnet prepared for you.
Once you learned the structure of data format, you are able to use your own data to esnet training.
